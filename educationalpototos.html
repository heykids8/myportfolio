<button type="button" onclick="alert('Immigration has been a big part in the United States. After World War I, there was a big distrust in immigrants,
later causing discrimination across the United States. Schools were affected by this too. Clearly not a big fan of immigrants!
Also, after World War I, when the Great Migration was going on, and more and more African Americans were moving up North,
many did not like this, causing many feuds and riots, especially in Chicago, where riots left 38 people dead and over
50 wounded and/or injured. Again, this affected schools, causing discrimination and segregation. Busing was also created somewhere
in the 1950's. This was the practice of assigning African Americans to schools in the suburbs in an effort to stop racial
segregation. Unfortunately, this didn't work.')">Learn More!</button>

The teachers were instructed to find any bad behavior in the students.There was no bad behavior in any of the students, but in
the results of the study, it was shown that most teachers claimed tohave seen more bad behavior in the black children rather than
the white children. Students also discriminate against their black classmates. According to race, religion, and skin color, bonding in
generalbecomes a struggle.')">Learn More!</button>
